## Why This Beats Every Alternative

### **vs. CINC ($1,099/month)**
- ❌ CINC: $200 extra for basic AI, no email AI, general real estate focus
- ✅ Builder Engine: All AI included, built for 200-day buyer cycles, SMS-controlled

### **vs. Top Producer ($179/month) + Smartzip ($299/month)**
- ❌ Competitors: Multiple tools, manual coordination, shared leads
- ✅ Builder Engine: Everything integrated, exclusive leads, text-controlled operations

### **vs. Building Your Own Stack**
- ❌ DIY Approach: 6-12 months setup, $50K+ in integrations, ongoing management
- ✅ Builder Engine: Live in 30 days, proven system, hands-free operation

**The math is simple:** Spend $3K-5K/month and get your time back, or spend $8K-15K cobbling together tools that don't talk to each other.

**Simple Acceleration Systems difference:** 100% client retention because we deliver results, not features.
